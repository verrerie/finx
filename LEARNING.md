## üìù Using Your Knowledge Base

The `.cursor/knowledge/` directory is your personal financial encyclopedia. As you learn, document concepts here.

### Structure

```
knowledge/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ concepts/           # Financial concepts you learn
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frameworks/         # Investment frameworks and strategies  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ journal/           # Your investment journal entries
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ glossary.md        # Financial terms dictionary
```

### How to Document Concepts

When you learn a new concept, create a markdown file:

**Example: `knowledge/concepts/price-to-earnings-ratio.md`**

```markdown
# Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio)

## What It Is
The P/E ratio measures how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of a company's earnings.

## Formula
P/E Ratio = Stock Price / Earnings Per Share (EPS)

## What It Means
- **High P/E**: Market expects strong future growth, or stock is overvalued
- **Low P/E**: Market has low expectations, or stock is undervalued
- **Industry Context**: Tech stocks typically have higher P/E than utilities

## Example
If Apple trades at $180 and has EPS of $6, P/E = 180/6 = 30
This means investors pay $30 for every $1 of Apple's earnings.

## When I Learned This
2025-10-26 - Compared AAPL (P/E ~30) vs JPM (P/E ~12) and understood why growth stocks have higher P/E.

## Related Concepts
- PEG Ratio (P/E adjusted for growth)
- Forward P/E vs Trailing P/E
- Sector-specific P/E norms
```

## üìî Investment Journal

Use the journal to track your thoughts and learn from outcomes.

**Example: `knowledge/journal/2025-10-26-apple-analysis.md`**

```markdown
# Apple (AAPL) - Initial Research

## Date
2025-10-26

## Thesis
Apple looks interesting because of strong iPhone 15 sales and services growth.

## Key Metrics
- P/E: 30.5 (vs sector avg: 28)
- Revenue Growth: 8% YoY
- Gross Margin: 44%

## My Questions
- Is P/E too high?
- How sustainable is services growth?
- What about competition from Android?

## Decision
Adding to watchlist. Need to understand competitive moat better.

## Follow-up
- Read last earnings call transcript
- Compare with Samsung, Google
- Understand Services breakdown
```

## ü§î Asking Better Questions

The system works best when you ask thoughtful questions:

**Instead of:** "What's the price of AAPL?"
**Ask:** "What's AAPL's current valuation and how does it compare to historical averages?"

**Instead of:** "Is TSLA a good buy?"
**Ask:** "What are TSLA's fundamentals, how do they compare to traditional auto makers, and what's the market pricing in?"

**Instead of:** "Show me data"
**Ask:** "Help me understand why company X's P/E is higher than company Y despite similar growth rates"
