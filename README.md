A learning-focused financial AI agent system built with MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. Designed to help you learn investment concepts through hands-on portfolio management and market analysis.

## üéØ Philosophy

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.x LTS or higher
- pnpm 9.x or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose (for database)
- Alpha Vantage API key (free tier: [Get one here](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key))
- Cursor IDE (for MCP integration)

### Installation

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**

```bash
cd finx
pnpm install
```

2. **Configure environment:**

```bash
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env and add:
# - Your Alpha Vantage API key
# - Database credentials (if changing defaults)
```

3. **Start the database:**

```bash
docker compose up -d mariadb
```

Verify it's running:
```bash
docker compose ps
```

See [docs/DATABASE.md](./docs/DATABASE.md) for detailed database documentation.

4. **Build all servers:**

```bash
pnpm build
```

5. **Configure MCP in Cursor:**

Add to your Cursor MCP configuration (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "finx-market-data": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/absolute/path/to/finx/mcp-market-data/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY": "your_key_here"
      }
    },
    "finx-portfolio": {
