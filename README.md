- **Portfolio Manager MCP Server** - Track holdings, transactions, and performance with learning features (Phase 1b)
- **MariaDB Database** - Local storage for portfolio data and learning journal (Phase 1b)
- **Knowledge Base** - Document financial concepts as you learn them
- **Cursor Integration** - Learning-oriented instructions and prompts
