A learning-focused financial AI agent system built with MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. Designed to help you learn investment concepts through hands-on portfolio management and market analysis.

## üéØ Philosophy

**Learn by Doing** - This is not just an investment tool; it's an educational platform that helps you understand financial concepts by applying them to real data and your actual portfolio.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

**Monorepo Structure** - pnpm workspaces with independently versioned packages

### MCP Servers (Workspace Packages)

- **@finx/mcp-market-data** - Real-time quotes, historical data, and company fundamentals with educational explanations
- **@finx/mcp-portfolio** - Track holdings, transactions, and performance with learning features

### Infrastructure

- **MariaDB 11.8** - Local storage for portfolio data and learning journal
- **Knowledge Base** - Document financial concepts as you learn them
- **Cursor Integration** - Learning-oriented instructions and prompts

See [docs/MONOREPO.md](./docs/MONOREPO.md) for detailed workspace documentation.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.x LTS or higher
- pnpm 9.x or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose (for database)
- Alpha Vantage API key (free tier: [Get one here](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key))
- Cursor IDE (for MCP integration)

### Installation

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**

```bash
cd finx
pnpm install  # Installs all workspace packages
```

This installs:
- Root dev dependencies (TypeScript, Vitest, etc.)
- Market Data server dependencies
- Portfolio server dependencies

2. **Configure environment:**

```bash
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env and add:
# - Your Alpha Vantage API key
# - Database credentials (if changing defaults)
```

3. **Start the database:**

```bash
docker compose up -d mariadb
```

Verify it's running:
```bash
docker compose ps
```

See [docs/DATABASE.md](./docs/DATABASE.md) for detailed database documentation.

4. **Configure MCP in Cursor:**

Add to your Cursor MCP configuration (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "finx-market-data": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/Users/verrerie/git/finx/dist/mcp-market-data/src/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY": "your_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

*(Update the path to match your installation location)*

5. **Build and start the server:**

```bash
# Development mode (auto-reload)
pnpm dev:market-data

# Production build
pnpm build:market-data
```
