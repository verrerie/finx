## 🛠️ Learning Workflows

### Workflow 1: Learning a New Concept

**Example: Understanding ROE**

1. **Ask AI:** "What is ROE, how is it calculated, why does it matter?"
2. **Get Examples:** Use `get_company_info` for 3 companies (high/medium/low ROE)
3. **Use Tool:** `explain_fundamental("roe")`
4. **Document:** Create `.cursor/knowledge/concepts/roe.md` with definition, formula, why it matters, what's "good", red flags, examples
5. **Practice:** Analyze 5-10 companies, compare ROEs in same sector

**Time:** 30-60 minutes | **Retention:** Much higher than just reading!

### Workflow 2: Researching a Company

**Example: Researching Tesla**

2. **Fundamentals:** `get_company_info("TSLA")` → All metrics
3. **Structured Analysis:** Use `decode-financials.md` prompt
4. **Compare:** `compare_peers("TSLA")` → vs competitors

## 💡 Learning Tips

### 1. Start Small, Go Deep
❌ Don't: Learn everything at once  
✅ Do: Master one concept or company at a time

**Example:** Deeply understand 3 companies in same sector > superficially research 20 stocks

### 2. Document Everything
❌ Don't: Keep thoughts in your head  
✅ Do: Write down your reasoning

**Why:** Forces clear thinking, enables learning from past decisions, shows evolution, reveals patterns

**What:** Why researched, what learned, why decided, what surprised, what you'd do differently

### 3. Embrace Being Wrong
❌ Don't: Hide mistakes  
✅ Do: Study what you got wrong and why

**How:** Review thesis → What assumptions wrong? → What missed? → What differently? → What learned?

**Remember:** Best investors wrong 40-50% of time. Key is learning from it.

### 4. Use Systematic Processes
❌ Don't: Gut feel decisions  
✅ Do: Repeatable process

**Checklist:** Business model ✓, Financial metrics ✓, Compare to peers ✓, Competitive advantages ✓, Bull/bear cases ✓, Position size ✓, Thesis documented ✓, Review date set ✓

### 5. Ask "Why" Repeatedly
❌ Don't: Accept numbers at face value  
✅ Do: Dig into what drives the numbers

**Example:** 30% margins → Why? Strong brand → Why? Decades quality → Why sustainable? Network effects → What breaks it? New tech

### 6. Learn from Multiple Perspectives
❌ Don't: Only confirming evidence  
✅ Do: Seek opposing views

**How:** Write strong bear case after bull case, find disagreeing analysts, ask "What changes my mind?"

### 7. Track Your Learning Journey
❌ Don't: Jump from topic to topic  
✅ Do: Reflect regularly

**Monthly Review:** New concepts learned, companies analyzed, mistakes made, questions for next month, progress assessment

## 🎯 Common Learning Challenges

1. **Information Overload:** Focus one concept/week, master basics first, depth > breadth
2. **Analysis Paralysis:** Set time limits (90 min), use decision frameworks, make decision even if uncertain
3. **Emotional Decisions:** Use `plan-transaction.md`, wait 24 hours, document reasoning, ask "Would I decide if price different?"
4. **Not Learning from Mistakes:** Write post-mortems, review quarterly, find patterns, celebrate avoiding repeats
5. **Comparing to Others:** YOUR journey at YOUR pace, focus on progress vs last month, consistency > perfection
