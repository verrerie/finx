## üõ†Ô∏è Learning Workflows

### Workflow 1: Learning a New Concept

**Example: Understanding ROE (Return on Equity)**

1. **Start with the AI:**
   ```
   "I want to learn about Return on Equity. What is it, how is it calculated,
   and why does it matter?"
   ```

2. **Get Real Examples:**
   ```
   Use get_company_info for 3 companies:
   - Company A (high ROE): Maybe a tech company
   - Company B (medium ROE): Maybe a retail company
   - Company C (low ROE): Maybe a utility
   ```

3. **Use the Explain Tool:**
   ```
   explain_fundamental("roe")
   ```

4. **Document Your Learning:**
   Create `.cursor/knowledge/concepts/roe.md`:
```markdown
   # Return on Equity (ROE)

   ## Definition
   [Your explanation in your own words]

## Formula
   ROE = Net Income / Shareholder Equity

   ## Why It Matters
   [Why this metric is important]

   ## What's "Good"
   - Tech companies: Often 15-30%+
   - Banks: Often 10-15%
   - Utilities: Often 8-12%
   - Context matters!

   ## Red Flags
   - Very high ROE (>40%) might indicate high leverage
   - Negative ROE means company is losing money
   - Declining ROE trend is concerning

   ## Examples I've Seen
   - [Company A]: ROE of 25% because...
   - [Company B]: ROE of 12% because...

## Related Concepts
   - ROA (Return on Assets)
   - ROIC (Return on Invested Capital)
   ```

5. **Practice Using It:**
   - Analyze 5-10 companies
   - Compare ROEs within same sector
   - Try to explain why they differ

**Time Investment:** 30-60 minutes  
**Retention:** Much higher than just reading about it!

### Workflow 2: Researching a Company

**Example: Deciding Whether to Research Tesla**

1. **Initial Quick Look:**
   ```
   get_quote("TSLA")
   ```
   See basic price, market cap, P/E ratio

2. **Fundamental Analysis:**
   ```
   get_company_info("TSLA")
   ```
   Review all key metrics

3. **Use the Structured Prompt:**
   Open `.cursor/prompts/decode-financials.md` and work through it systematically

4. **Compare to Peers:**
   ```
   compare_peers("TSLA", metrics=["market_cap", "pe_ratio", "revenue_growth"])
   ```

5. **Document Your Analysis:**
   Create `.cursor/knowledge/journal/2025-01-15-tesla-analysis.md`:
```markdown
   # Tesla Analysis - January 15, 2025

   ## Business Model
   [What does Tesla do? How do they make money?]

## Key Metrics
   - Market Cap: $XXX billion
   - P/E Ratio: XX (vs auto industry average of YY)
   - Revenue Growth: XX% YoY
   - Profit Margin: XX%

   ## Bull Case
   1. [Reason 1]
   2. [Reason 2]
   3. [Reason 3]

   ## Bear Case
   1. [Risk 1]
   2. [Risk 2]
   3. [Risk 3]

   ## My Thesis
   [In 2-3 paragraphs, explain whether you'd consider owning this and why]

   ## Questions I Still Have
   - [Question 1]
   - [Question 2]

## Decision
   - [ ] Add to watchlist
   - [ ] Need more research
   - [ ] Pass for now

## Follow-up
   [When should I revisit this?]
   ```

**Time Investment:** 60-90 minutes for thorough analysis  
**Output:** Clear documented reasoning about the company

### Workflow 3: Building a Portfolio

**Example: Creating Your First Simulated Portfolio**

1. **Define Your Strategy:**
   Document in `.cursor/knowledge/frameworks/my-investment-approach.md`:
   ```markdown
   # My Investment Approach

   ## Goals
   - Long-term wealth building (10+ years)
   - Learn to analyze businesses
   - Build conviction-weighted portfolio

   ## Principles
   1. Only invest in what I understand
   2. Prefer quality over price
   3. Think like an owner, not a trader
   4. Diversify across 8-12 positions
   5. Document every decision

   ## Allocation Targets
   - Tech: 30-40%
   - Healthcare: 15-20%
   - Consumer: 15-20%
   - Financial: 10-15%
   - Other: 10-15%
   ```

2. **Create Portfolio:**
   ```
   create_portfolio({
     name: "Learning Portfolio",
     description: "Practice portfolio for learning investment concepts",
     currency: "USD"
   })
   ```

3. **Research Candidates:**
   - Use Workflow 2 for each company
   - Document thesis for each
   - Add promising ones to watchlist

4. **Make Simulated Purchases:**
   Before each purchase, use `plan-transaction.md` prompt:
   ```
   - What's my thesis?
   - What's my target allocation?
   - Have I done enough research?
   - What could go wrong?
   - What's my exit strategy?
   ```

   Then execute:
   ```
   add_transaction({
     portfolio_id: "...",
     symbol: "AAPL",
     type: "BUY",
     quantity: 10,
     price: 175.00,
     transaction_date: "2025-01-15",
     notes: "Initial position - services growth thesis"
   })
   ```

5. **Track and Review:**
   - Weekly: Check performance with `calculate_performance`
   - Monthly: Full review with `analyze-portfolio.md` prompt
   - Quarterly: Deep dive on each position with `evaluate-position.md`

**Time Investment:** 
- Initial: 4-6 hours for strategy and first 3-5 positions
- Ongoing: 1-2 hours weekly

## üí° Learning Tips

### 1. Start Small, Go Deep
‚ùå Don't: Try to learn everything at once  
‚úÖ Do: Master one concept or company at a time

**Example:**
Instead of superficially researching 20 stocks, deeply understand 3 companies in the same sector. You'll learn more about that industry than you would from cursory looks at many companies.

### 2. Document Everything
‚ùå Don't: Keep thoughts in your head  
‚úÖ Do: Write down your reasoning

**Why It Matters:**
- Writing forces clear thinking
- You can review and learn from past decisions
- You'll see how your understanding evolves
- It's easier to spot patterns in your thinking

**What to Document:**
- Why you researched a company
- What you learned
- Why you made (or didn't make) a decision
- What surprised you
- What you'd do differently

### 3. Embrace Being Wrong
‚ùå Don't: Hide mistakes or make excuses  
‚úÖ Do: Study what you got wrong and why

**How to Learn from Mistakes:**
1. Review your original thesis
2. What assumptions were wrong?
3. What did you miss in your research?
4. What would you do differently now?
5. What can you learn for next time?

**Remember:** Even the best investors are wrong 40-50% of the time. The key is learning from it.

### 4. Use Systematic Processes
‚ùå Don't: Make decisions based on "gut feel"  
‚úÖ Do: Have a repeatable process

**Example Checklist for Every Investment:**
- [ ] Understand the business model
- [ ] Reviewed financial metrics
- [ ] Compared to 2-3 peers
- [ ] Identified competitive advantages
- [ ] Articulated bull and bear cases
- [ ] Determined appropriate position size
- [ ] Documented investment thesis
- [ ] Set review date

### 5. Ask "Why" Repeatedly
‚ùå Don't: Accept numbers at face value  
‚úÖ Do: Dig into what drives the numbers

**Example:**
- Company A has 30% profit margins
- Why? ‚Üí Strong brand allows premium pricing
- Why strong brand? ‚Üí Decades of quality and marketing
- Why sustainable? ‚Üí Network effects and high switching costs
- What could break it? ‚Üí New technology, changing preferences

### 6. Learn from Multiple Perspectives
‚ùå Don't: Only look for confirming evidence  
‚úÖ Do: Actively seek out opposing views

**How:**
- After writing a bull case, force yourself to write an equally strong bear case
- Find analysts or investors who disagree
- Ask: "What would I need to see to change my mind?"

### 7. Track Your Learning Journey
‚ùå Don't: Just move from topic to topic  
‚úÖ Do: Reflect on what you're learning

**Monthly Learning Review:**
```markdown
# Learning Review - January 2025

## New Concepts Learned
1. [Concept] - Now I understand...
2. [Concept] - This clicked when...

## Companies Analyzed
- [Company]: Key insight was...
- [Company]: Surprised to learn...

## Mistakes Made

## üéØ Common Learning Challenges

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Reminders

   - There's no "right" pace
   - What matters is continuous learning and improvement

3. **The goal is wisdom, not just knowledge**
   - Knowing formulas isn't enough
   - Understanding WHY things work matters more
   - Developing good judgment takes time

4. **When in doubt, get professional help**
   - Tax implications: Talk to a CPA
   - Financial planning: Talk to a CFP
   - Large decisions: Get a second opinion
   - This system supplements, not replaces, professional advice

**Happy Learning!** üéìüìà
