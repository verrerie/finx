## 🛠️ Learning Workflows

### Workflow 1: Learning a New Concept

**Example: Understanding ROE**

1. **Ask AI:** "What is ROE, how is it calculated, why does it matter?"
2. **Get Examples:** Use `get_company_info` for 3 companies (high/medium/low ROE)
3. **Use Tool:** `explain_fundamental("roe")`
4. **Document:** Create `.cursor/knowledge/concepts/roe.md` with definition, formula, why it matters, what's "good", red flags, examples
5. **Practice:** Analyze 5-10 companies, compare ROEs in same sector

**Time:** 30-60 minutes | **Retention:** Much higher than just reading!

### Workflow 2: Researching a Company

**Example: Researching Tesla**

1. **Quick Look:** `get_quote("TSLA")` → Price, market cap, P/E
2. **Fundamentals:** `get_company_info("TSLA")` → All metrics
3. **Structured Analysis:** Use `decode-financials.md` prompt
4. **Compare:** `compare_peers("TSLA")` → vs competitors
5. **Document:** Create journal entry with business model, key metrics, bull/bear cases, thesis, questions, decision

**Example: Creating Your First Simulated Portfolio**

1. **Define Strategy:** Document in `.cursor/knowledge/frameworks/my-investment-approach.md` (goals, principles, allocation targets)
2. **Create Portfolio:** `create_portfolio()` → Name it "Learning Portfolio"
3. **Research Candidates:** Use Workflow 2 for each company → Document thesis → Add to watchlist
4. **Make Purchases:** Before each, use `plan-transaction.md` prompt → Execute with `add_transaction()` → Document reasoning
5. **Track & Review:** Weekly performance check, monthly full review, quarterly deep dives

**Time:** Initial 4-6 hours, then 1-2 hours weekly

## 💡 Learning Tips

### 1. Start Small, Go Deep
❌ Don't: Learn everything at once  
✅ Do: Master one concept or company at a time

**Example:** Deeply understand 3 companies in same sector > superficially research 20 stocks

### 2. Document Everything
❌ Don't: Keep thoughts in your head  
✅ Do: Write down your reasoning

**Why:** Forces clear thinking, enables learning from past decisions, shows evolution, reveals patterns

**What:** Why researched, what learned, why decided, what surprised, what you'd do differently

### 3. Embrace Being Wrong
❌ Don't: Hide mistakes  
✅ Do: Study what you got wrong and why

**How:** Review thesis → What assumptions wrong? → What missed? → What differently? → What learned?

**Remember:** Best investors wrong 40-50% of time. Key is learning from it.

### 4. Use Systematic Processes
❌ Don't: Gut feel decisions  
✅ Do: Repeatable process

**Checklist:** Business model ✓, Financial metrics ✓, Compare to peers ✓, Competitive advantages ✓, Bull/bear cases ✓, Position size ✓, Thesis documented ✓, Review date set ✓

### 5. Ask "Why" Repeatedly
❌ Don't: Accept numbers at face value  
✅ Do: Dig into what drives the numbers

**Example:** 30% margins → Why? Strong brand → Why? Decades quality → Why sustainable? Network effects → What breaks it? New tech

### 6. Learn from Multiple Perspectives
❌ Don't: Only confirming evidence  
✅ Do: Seek opposing views

**How:** Write strong bear case after bull case, find disagreeing analysts, ask "What changes my mind?"

### 7. Track Your Learning Journey
❌ Don't: Jump from topic to topic  
✅ Do: Reflect regularly

**Monthly Review:** New concepts learned, companies analyzed, mistakes made, questions for next month, progress assessment

## 📊 Measuring Your Progress

### Beginner (Months 1-3)
**Ready when:** Can explain metrics without looking up, understand P/E/ROE/margins, read financial data, form opinions, document consistently

### Intermediate (Months 4-8)
**Progress when:** Analyze company in 60-90 min, think bull/bear cases, recognize patterns, explain valuation differences, make documented decisions

### Advanced (Months 9+)
**Advancing when:** Repeatable process, spot when metrics incomplete, comfortable with uncertainty, learn from wins/losses, developing philosophy

---

## 🎯 Common Learning Challenges

1. **Information Overload:** Focus one concept/week, master basics first, depth > breadth
2. **Analysis Paralysis:** Set time limits (90 min), use decision frameworks, make decision even if uncertain
3. **Emotional Decisions:** Use `plan-transaction.md`, wait 24 hours, document reasoning, ask "Would I decide if price different?"
4. **Not Learning from Mistakes:** Write post-mortems, review quarterly, find patterns, celebrate avoiding repeats
5. **Comparing to Others:** YOUR journey at YOUR pace, focus on progress vs last month, consistency > perfection
