## Best Practices

### General Principles

1. **Document Everything:** Every decision needs written rationale, use notes fields, maintain theses
2. **Use What-If Before Acting:** Never buy/sell without scenario analysis, understand impact
3. **Review Regularly:** Weekly (watchlist), Monthly (performance), Quarterly (theses)
4. **Learn from Everything:** Winners (what worked?), Losers (what missed?), Market moves
5. **Stay Organized:** One portfolio per strategy, clear naming, regular knowledge base updates

### Research Best Practices

1. **Start Broad, Then Go Deep:** Quick look ‚Üí Full picture ‚Üí Context ‚Üí Learning
2. **Always Compare:** Never analyze in isolation, compare to peers/history/portfolio
3. **Question Everything:** High margin (why? sustainable?), Fast growth (from where?), Low valuation (what's wrong?)

### Portfolio Management

1. **Position Sizing:** No position >20% at entry, Top conviction: 10-15%, Medium: 5-10%, Low: 2-5%
2. **Diversification:** Across sectors, company sizes, business models (but don't over-diversify)
3. **Rebalancing:** When position >25%, when thesis changes, when better opportunities arise
4. **Tax Awareness:** Long-term > short-term gains, tax-loss harvesting, consider timing

### Learning Best Practices

1. **Concepts Before Companies:** Understand metrics first, then apply to companies
2. **Depth Over Breadth:** 3 companies deeply > 30 superficially
3. **Document Your Journey:** Track learning, note insights, review past analyses
4. **Embrace Mistakes:** You will be wrong, that's how you learn, document why
