## üìä Best Practices

### 1. Use Learning Mode
The system is designed for education. Always ask for explanations:

**Good:** "Explain Apple's P/E ratio and why it's higher than the sector average"
**Less Good:** "What's Apple's P/E?"

### 2. Document Everything
Your knowledge base is your most valuable asset:
- Journal every research session
- Document concepts as you learn them
- Build a glossary of terms
- Track your investment theses

### 3. Start Broad, Then Deep
- Begin with `get_quote()` for overview
- Move to `get_company_info()` for details
- Use `explain_fundamental()` for education
- End with `compare_peers()` for context

### 4. Question the Data
- Why is this metric high/low?
- How does it compare to competitors?
- What's the historical trend?
- What might change in the future?

### 5. Cross-Reference
Don't rely solely on this tool:
- Check company investor relations sites
- Read recent news
- Look at SEC filings
- Verify with multiple sources
