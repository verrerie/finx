## Testing Tips

### 1. Natural Language Queries

The tools work with natural language:

- "Compare Apple vs Microsoft" â†’ Uses compare_peers
- "Show me tech companies" â†’ Might use compare_peers

### 2. Follow-Up Questions

Ask follow-up questions to test context awareness:
```
User: "What's Apple's P/E ratio?"
AI: (Shows quote with P/E)
User: "Explain that metric"
AI: (Should explain P/E ratio)
```

### 3. Learning Workflows

Test educational progressions:
```
Beginner: "What does market cap mean?"
â†’ "Why does it matter?"
