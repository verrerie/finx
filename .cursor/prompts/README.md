## Tips for Effective Learning

### 1. Start Small
- One concept at a time
- One company per session
- Compare only 2-3 companies initially
- Build depth before breadth

### 2. Use Real Examples
- Always use actual companies, not hypotheticals
- Compare real data, not textbook examples
- Your money (theoretical or real) on the line = better learning

### 3. Ask "Why"
- Don't just accept the numbers
- Understand WHY metrics are what they are
- Ask: "What business decisions led to these results?"

### 4. Document Everything
- Write down what you learn
- Note questions that arise
- Track your reasoning
- Review past analyses to see how you've grown

### 5. Be Patient
- Financial literacy is a journey, not a destination
- Understanding deeply > knowing superficially
- Quality of analysis > quantity of stocks researched
- It's okay to say "I don't understand this yet"

### 6. Question Your Assumptions
- Play devil's advocate to your own analysis
- Consider the bear case, not just the bull case
- Ask: "What would change my mind?"
- Remember: No investment is a "sure thing"

## Learning Progression

### Phase 1a (Current): Fundamentals
**Focus**: Understanding financial metrics and company analysis

**Goal**: Read financial data and understand what it means

### Phase 1b (Next): Portfolio Management

**Phase 2**: Financial statement deep dives and valuation

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to use all three prompts for every stock?**
A: No! Use what's helpful for your current learning goal. Sometimes just one prompt is enough.

**Q: How long should each session take?**
A: 15-60 minutes depending on depth. Quality > speed. It's better to understand one company deeply than to superficially analyze five.

**Q: What if I don't understand something?**
A: Perfect! Ask follow-up questions. The AI is here to teach, not just provide data. Questions like "Can you explain that differently?" or "Why does that matter?" are encouraged.

**Q: Should I analyze stocks I want to buy?**
A: Not necessarily! Analyzing well-known companies (even if you don't plan to buy them) is a great way to learn. You're building mental models that transfer to other companies.

**Q: How do I know if I'm learning?**
A: Try explaining a concept to someone else (or write it down). If you can teach it, you've learned it.

## Getting Help

If you're stuck or confused:
1. Ask clarifying questions in Cursor chat
2. Use the `learn-concept.md` prompt for specific metrics you don't understand
3. Review the `.cursorrules` file for examples of good explanations
4. Check your `knowledge/` directory for concepts you've already documented
