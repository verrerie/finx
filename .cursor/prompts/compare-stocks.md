Please help me:

### 1. Establish Comparability

First, confirm if these companies are truly comparable:

### 3. Financial Metrics Head-to-Head

Create a comparison table with context for each metric:

## Advanced Comparison Techniques

### Relative Valuation
Instead of "is this stock cheap?", ask "which is cheaper relative to what you get?"
- Compare P/E ratios, but adjust for growth (PEG)
- Compare market caps, but adjust for revenue or profit
- Look at EV/EBITDA, Price/Sales, Price/Book

### Operational Comparison
Look beyond financials to operations:
- Efficiency: Revenue per employee, asset turnover
- Quality: Customer retention, brand value
- Innovation: R&D spending, patent filings
- Management: Insider ownership, capital allocation

### Risk-Adjusted Comparison
Consider not just returns, but risk:
- Debt levels and interest coverage
- Business model resilience in recessions
- Competitive moat strength
- Regulatory and legal risks

## Common Comparison Pitfalls

**❌ Mistakes to Avoid:**
1. **Apples to Oranges** - Comparing truly incomparable businesses
2. **Simplistic "Better"** - One metric doesn't tell the whole story
3. **Ignoring Context** - Why metrics differ matters as much as that they differ
4. **Recency Bias** - Recent performance doesn't predict future
5. **Missing the Forest** - Getting lost in details, missing big picture
6. **False Dichotomy** - Sometimes both are good (or both are bad)

**✅ Good Practices:**
1. **Start with business models** - Understand WHAT before comparing HOW MUCH
2. **Multiple metrics** - Use 5-10 metrics, not just one
3. **Explain differences** - WHY are they different?
4. **Consider goals** - Better for what purpose?
5. **Think combinations** - Could you own both?
6. **Learn patterns** - What makes companies in this sector successful?

## Comparison Questions to Explore

**After each comparison, ask:**
- What surprised me?
- Which company do I understand better now?
- What would I need to know to feel confident choosing one?
- How do their strategies differ?
- Which management team do I trust more?
- If I had to pick just one, which and why?
- If I could own both, what % allocation for each?

Sometimes the best answer is "both are good for different reasons" or "neither fits my investment goals."
