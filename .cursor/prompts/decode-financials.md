## Learning Notes

**Remember:**

- No company is perfect - look for acceptable flaws
- What matters most varies by investment style (value vs growth vs income)
- Market price already reflects a lot of information
- Your advantage is patience and long-term thinking

**Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid:**
- ❌ Looking at metrics in isolation (always compare to peers and history)
- ❌ Falling in love with a story without checking the numbers
- ❌ Ignoring risks because you like the company
- ❌ Thinking you've found a "sure thing"
- ❌ Not documenting your reasoning

**Good Habits:**
- ✅ Compare everything (to peers, to history, to expectations)
- ✅ Question your own assumptions
- ✅ Document your thesis before investing
- ✅ Revisit your analysis periodically
- ✅ Learn from both successes and mistakes

**The goal isn't to find perfect companies - it's to understand the companies you own.**
