2. **Explain why it matters** - Why do investors care about this metric?

3. **Show me how to calculate it** - Use a real company example (like Apple or Microsoft)

4. **Put it in context** - What's a "good" vs "bad" value? How does it vary by industry?

6. **Common pitfalls** - What mistakes do beginners make when using this metric?

7. **Related concepts** - What other metrics or concepts should I learn next?

8. **Practice exercise** - Give me a company to analyze using this concept

After the explanation, help me:
