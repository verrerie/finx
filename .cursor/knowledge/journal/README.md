# Investment Research Journal

This is where you document your research, thoughts, and investment theses.

## Why Keep a Journal?

1. **Track Your Reasoning** - Remember why you made decisions
2. **Learn from Outcomes** - Compare predictions to reality
3. **Spot Patterns** - Identify what works for you
4. **Build Discipline** - Writing forces clear thinking
5. **Measure Growth** - See how your analysis improves over time

## Best Practices

1. **Date Everything** - Track when you learned what
2. **Be Honest** - Document concerns, not just bullish points
3. **Note Questions** - What you don't understand is as important as what you do
4. **Update Regularly** - Come back and add new insights
5. **Review Outcomes** - Did your thesis play out? Why or why not?
