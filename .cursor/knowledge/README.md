# Financial Knowledge Base

This is your personal financial education repository. As you learn concepts through using FinX, document them here.

## Structure

- **concepts/** - Individual financial concepts and metrics
- **frameworks/** - Investment frameworks and strategies
- **journal/** - Your investment research journal
- **glossary.md** - Quick reference for financial terms

## How to Use

### Document New Concepts

When you learn something new, create a markdown file:

**Example:** `concepts/price-to-earnings-ratio.md`

Include:
- What it is
- Formula/calculation
- What it means
- Real examples
- When you learned it
- Related concepts

### Keep a Research Journal

For each stock or topic you research, create a journal entry:

**Example:** `journal/2025-10-26-apple-research.md`

Include:
- Date
- Your thesis/hypothesis
- Key metrics
- Questions raised
- Decision made
- Follow-up items

### Build Your Glossary

Add terms to `glossary.md` as you encounter them. Keep it simple and in your own words.

## Tips

1. **Write in your own words** - Paraphrasing helps learning
2. **Include examples** - Real companies make concepts concrete
3. **Link concepts** - Note related ideas
4. **Update as you learn** - Come back and refine as understanding deepens
5. **Date everything** - Track your learning journey
