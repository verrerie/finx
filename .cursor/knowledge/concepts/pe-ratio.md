# P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings)

## Definition
The P/E ratio shows how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of a company's annual earnings. It's a valuation metric that helps determine if a stock is expensive or cheap relative to its profits.

## Formula
```
P/E Ratio = Stock Price / Earnings Per Share (EPS)
```

Example: Stock at $100 with $5 EPS â†’ P/E = 20

## Why It Matters
- **Valuation comparison**: Compare similar companies
- **Market expectations**: High P/E = market expects growth
- **Value indicator**: Low P/E may indicate undervaluation (or problems)
- **Quick screening**: Filter stocks by valuation level

## How to Interpret

**Context is everything!** Compare to:
1. Company's historical P/E
2. Industry/sector average
3. Overall market (S&P 500 ~15-20)
4. Growth rate (use PEG for this)

### General Ranges
- **Low (<15)**: Value stocks, mature companies, or distressed
- **Medium (15-25)**: Market average, fair valuation
- **High (25-40)**: Growth stocks, high expectations
- **Very High (40+)**: Extreme growth expectations or speculation

### Red Flags
- P/E much higher than sector without growth justification
- Declining earnings with high P/E
- Negative earnings (P/E undefined)

## Examples

### Technology Sector (2024)
- **Apple**: P/E ~30 - Premium valuation, strong brand
- **Microsoft**: P/E ~35 - Growth + stability premium  
- **Google**: P/E ~25 - Reasonable for tech giant

### Comparison with Maturity
- **Tech Growth**: P/E 30-50+ (high growth expected)
- **Consumer Staples**: P/E 15-25 (stable, slower growth)
- **Utilities**: P/E 10-20 (predictable, low growth)

## Related Concepts
- **PEG Ratio** - P/E adjusted for growth rate
- **Forward P/E** - Uses next year's estimated earnings
- **EPS** - The denominator in P/E calculation
- **Earnings Yield** - Inverse of P/E (E/P)

## Limitations
- Doesn't account for growth (use PEG instead)
- Earnings can be manipulated (check quality)
- Not useful for loss-making companies
- Ignores debt levels (check EV/EBITDA too)
- Different accounting across countries

## My Notes
**When I use it:**
- First pass screening for value vs growth
- Comparing direct competitors
- Checking if market expectations are reasonable

**What I've learned:**
- Can't use P/E alone - need to understand WHY it's high/low
- Sector matters more than I thought
- Compare to company's own history, not just market

**Questions to explore:**
- How do buybacks affect P/E over time?
- At what P/E do growth stocks become "expensive"?
